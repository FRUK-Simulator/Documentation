# Project Goal
Provide a learning platform where students can explore and learn the practical challenges involved with using programming to control a robot. Learning to code withsome real world constraints will hopefully provide the necessary motivation and challenges to make it interesting. The tool is intended to be used in a classroom setting with exercises for learning. Additionally the tool should allow students to experiment freely.

## Key Points
* Aimed at 12 year old (key stage 3) students.
* Browser based (chrome, firefox).
* Should require coding knowledge to the same level as the existing First UK Tech challenge for the same age group.
* Software should be able to run on cheap laptops and classroom PCs.

## Technology Stack
### Frontend
* HTML, CSS
* TypeScript
* Webpack
* Three.js (WebGL) - For 3D rendering
* Google Blockly - For block code editor
* Monaco - For text editor (possibly not needed)

### Backend
* Python / Node.js
* Nginx / AWS - For static frontend file serving
* Postgres - For databases
